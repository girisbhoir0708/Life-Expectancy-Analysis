# Life-Expectancy-Analysis

This project analyzes global life expectancy trends from 2000 to 2015 across 193 countries, focusing on factors like healthcare, education, immunization, and socio-economic indicators. By employing machine learning techniques, the project seeks to identify key variables affecting life expectancy and predict outcomes for different countries. The dataset includes diverse metrics such as adult and infant mortality rates, GDP, immunization coverage, healthcare expenditure, and schooling years, sourced from the WHO and the United Nations.

# Objective 
The primary goal is to determine critical factors influencing life expectancy and provide actionable insights for countries to improve their population's health and longevity. The analysis addresses questions like the impact of immunization, the role of healthcare spending, correlations with lifestyle factors, and the influence of economic indicators.
